We thank the reviewer for the comments. As requested, some clarifications
are in order.

First, we certainly agree with the reviewer that it is unlikely that
networks consisting of C tournaments would arise in practice. We do
not think we have ever witnessed such a thing despite of long
experience on BNSL. However, the motivation for the
section 3.3 was different.  Silander et al.(2010) motivated their fNML
criterion by the NML criterion, but these two scores generally only
coincide for the simplest of the networks, the empty network. Section 3.3
shows that the qNML-score equals NML for many (admittedly particular)
models of different complexity. This raises hopes(!) that qNML is not
far from NML in general, a topic that is subject to further study
(which should be mentioned in the final version of the paper thus
thank you again for the comment.)

Likewise, we agree that in the longer version of the paper, more
experiments should be made. Resorting to the artificial data has
certainly its problems. We chose the method, say over the ALARM
network, because it allowed us to use exact structure learning and
because we wanted to copy the paradigm of Silander et al. for fNML
(good or bad).

Finally, all the studied criteria are asymptotically equivalent to BIC
(or to each other in general). While fNML features rather
strong bias to parsimony, BIC does so even more.
